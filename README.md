# Odeyalify
Odeyalify is my own spotify analog.
Simple backend, that returns JSON and communicate with frontend using REST API. 
Now backend can: 
Upload  audio, image files,  stream audio, register and login user, update information about user, generate QR code for link or any text, verify artist, create playlist,
manipulate with playlist entity, such add or remove song, remove playlist, get playlist by id, generate access link for playlist.  
Send email to artist subscribers(only for subs, that enable notifications)
